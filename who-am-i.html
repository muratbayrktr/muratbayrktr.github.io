        I am currently studying Computer Engineering in Middle East Technical University, aka. ODTU. During my secondary school years, I started playing
        piano (+10 yrs) and I am still fond of it. Later on, I improved myself on electric-guitar (+3 yrs) and alto-saxophone (+2 yrs). I also compose songs
        with piano; in fact, one of my pieces was published in TRT Music. You can find more details on <span style="color:hotpink">My Music</span>  page.

        I love spending my time by doing researches about
        the topics that I am interested. I am neither introvert nor extrovert. We might say I am an ambivert. In fine conditions and when I feel like
        it I flip into extroversion. However, sometimes I want to be alone and isolate myself from the external world. That way, I can think of where I am
        in the real world. This prevents me from being driven away from the path that I want to walk.

        Let's talk about my favorite activites. 
        <span class="ae-2 large margin-bottom-2" style="color:bisque"> 
        
        <br><br>    >   Night-walks!.. but it should be alone with a headphone playing my favorite songs.
        <br><br>    >   Going out with friends at nights! I love spending time with my friends at nights. One of our favorite spot is Devrim Stadium.
        <br><br>    >   Playing piano is indeed one of my favs! Lol.
        <br><br>    >   Even though I love playing computer games, it's no fun w/o the boys!
        <br><br>    >   I really like being healthy and in good shape. So as long as I can arrange myself I workout. MUSCLE BABY!
        <br><br>    >   Doing researches on topics that I am interested. I have a fetish on mathematical definitions... So yeah I enjoy solving those math proof puzzles!
        <br><br>    >   Filtered Coffe. That amazing drink can be a whole favorite activity on its own. I must drink one cup in the mornings for sure!
